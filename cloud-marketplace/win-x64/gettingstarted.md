## Usage Instructions / Getting Started 

1. Launch your VM or instance and RDP into the Windows server with your chosen credentials (specified when creating the VM)
2. Launch the Titan Neo Server Administrator UI by clicking on the desktop icon for the Titan Neo Server. The first time you run the Administrator it will prompt you to create a new Administrator account to allow configuring the Titan Neo Server.
